**Slack:** #propublica

**Project Description:** This ProPublica repository is part of Data for Democracy. Our purpose is to collaboratively work through analytic processes that support the journalism at ProPublica. 

## Analysis Workflow

### Loading and Cleaning Datasets
For each analysis, data needs to be loaded and cleaned to a format that is useable for the current analysis and for future analyses.

After data has been cleaned, both the raw data and cleaned data should be uploaded to a project-specific data.world repo. Additionally, the project's readme should be updated with a summary of the cleansing process and any code associated with cleaning should be pushed to the project's GitHub repo.

### Exploratory Analysis
Team members working in exploratory analysis work up general statistics, distributions of important variables, and hypotheses based on initial exploration of covariation.

When an analysis job is complete, a pull request to the GitHub repo should be made to be edited by collaborators of the project or a committee of assigned editors.

### Modeling
Team members use modeling techniques to test the hypotheses generated in the exploratory analysis phase and to quantify relationships between variables in the data. Team members may also be working to test specific hypotheses generated by ProPublica.

Algorithms used in the modeling should be vetted through open discussions with the team and through pull requests, and final model specification should be a collaborative effort using any individual findings from the discussion. The project readme should outline these specifications, and the final modeling code should be pushed to the GitHub repo.

### Reporting
Team members detail the findings in a reproducible report that can be immediately used by ProPublica. All sources and data used should be linked in the report, and the project readme containing all background in methodology and links to data and code.

## More About This Project
The purpose of these scripts is to download third quarter data describing the 
House of Representative's expenditures. Running do.R will load, combine, and clean
all Q3 data.

You'll need to set your working directory.

These data and the remaining quarters can be found here: 

[https://projects.propublica.org/represent/expenditures](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/expenditures)

You can read more about this data set on [ProPublica's post](https://www.propublica.org/article/update-on-house-disbursements-a-few-notes-on-how-to-use-the-data).  

### Cleaning 

I removed commas from the dollar amounts and converted the start and end dates to the date 
format. 

_Update January 1, 2017, 9:44 PM_
I added code in the cleaning section of explore_house_exp.Rmd to change 2009-2015 figures 
to 2016 dollars using inflation rates I found on [http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/). 
I only changed it in explore_house_exp.Rmd, not in clean.R.

### Next Steps
  
- I'll be working on functions that will identify basic statistics.  
- The office, payee, and recipient fields aren't standardized so unique entities 
that are spelled differently need to be collapsed into one value. You 
can read more about that problem under the "How We Collect the Data" section of 
[ProPublica's post](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/expenditures).
